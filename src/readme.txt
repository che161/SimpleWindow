This project is my first R project for dealing with one set of my research project data. The project investigates the effect of a new simple modelling method for window systems in houses in comparison with the existing more detailed window modelling method. Using these two window modelling methods, the research simulated and obtained house energy star rating for around 30 thounsand real house designs across the eight states and territories. The research is to find the differences in the star rating for the houses to see the impact of the simple window modelling method.

All the data were generated by myself when I run a buildnig simulation software developed by CSIRO using the two window modelling methods. 

Result2.txt contains information of for all real house designs in Australia which I have collected via a webportal managed by CSIRO. So, there are information of these real houses which are confidential.

Result2_error.txt contains information of those real house designs which cannot run through with the simulation using the new window modelling method due to various reason. Comparison will only be carried out for those hosues which can run with the simulation using the new window modelling method.

Result2.csv and Result2_Orig.csv contain the simulation results which are required for the comparison. However, they both include all the real house designs. So, I need to use the informatio in Result2_error.txt and Result2.txt to work out only those simulation results for houses which run with both the simulations. SimWindow.R is the R script to use Result2.txt, Result2_error.txt, Result2.csv and Result2_Orig.csv to generate two clean data set Result2_Clean.csv Result2_Orig_Clean.csv which only contain the simulation results for houses which can run both window modelling methods.

The above processing is state by state. Then, the star-rating differences for all the states and terretories are combined in one csv file Result2_Orig_Clean_AllState.csv for plotting using Plots.R.
