# Introduction
I am a research scientist at CSIRO Energy. I have been coding in the areas of computational fluid dynamics and building simulations for over 30 years using FORTRAN. Currently, my main work focuses on house energy efficency research experimentally, analytically and numerically. These research findings may be then transferred into FORTRAN coding to improve a CSIRO owned software called AccuRate/Chenath engine, which is used for house energy rating in Australia. 

# My Project
This study investigated the impact of improving the AccuRate/Chenath engine with a simple window model to replace the existing window model in eight states and terretories. Energy rating results were obtained for a total of 30,000 dwellings using the existing and the improved Chenath engines.However, around 5,000 houses in these data files have various issues which need to be removed before the comparison. So, this R project needs to remove the data for these houses with issues and clean the data sets. Then, the star rating differeces obtained using the two Chenath engines obtained for each dwellings. Average values for each state are calculated and plotted. These information will be used for decide whether the simple window model can be used for house energy rating in future in Australia. 

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

```{r, out.width="300px",fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/Figure_2b.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/Figure_3.png")
```

![](resources/img/tidyverse.png){width=100px}

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Yet another gapminder plot"}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of the project took the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
